### **Overview**
In this repository, I implemented **Batch Normalization** within a neural network framework to enhance training stability and performance, following Andrej Karpathy's approach in the **Makemore - Part 3** video.

This implementation focuses on **normalizing activations and gradients, addressing initialization issues, and utilizing Kaiming initialization to prevent saturation of activation functions**. Additionally, **visualization graphs** were created at the end to analyze the effects of these techniques on the training process and model performance.

### **📄Instructions**

To get the best understanding:

1. Start by reading the notes in the `notes/` directory. Each section corresponds to a notebook for step-by-step explanations.
2. Open the corresponding Jupyter Notebook (e.g., `A-Main-Notebook.ipynb` for `A-main-makemore-part3.md`).
3. Follow the code and comments for a deeper dive into the implementation details.
